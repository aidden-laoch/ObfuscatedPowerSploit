# ObfuscatedPowerSploit
scripts encrypted with out-encryptscript.ps1 and personal passphrase

This is for our team use. The encryption key to unzip is reg*2 and the key to run them is reg.

All scripts were out-EncryptScript.ps1 encrypted with reg salty.


Encryption is not ment to be end all be all to be completely secure. These are open source tools just encrypted to bypass AV for our assessment coming up.

In the future these should be redone with a new passphase for each assessment.

Added script to use out-encryptscript for entire directories so others can replicate what I did easier.
